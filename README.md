A ZX skeleton app for compiling with Z88DK.

Just copy these files in a directory, add your .c and .asm files in the same
dir, ensure that you change the `main()` function to call your code and run
`make` to compile and link everything.

Run `make run` to run the created `.tap` file with Fuse emulator.
